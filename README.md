# auto-learn-bot

A sophisticated bot designed for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with advanced observation and learning capabilities. It starts by entering an 'observation mode' upon hearing the trigger word 'observe'. In this mode, the bot uses screen capture and computer vision to learn user actions. After learning, it indicates readiness with a 'ready' signal. The user then triggers task execution by commanding 'do it', prompting the bot to replicate the observed tasks. This system incorporates NLP for command processing, computer vision for action recognition, and scripting for task execution, aiming to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.
